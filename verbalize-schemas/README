To run the code in Lisp,

(load "init.lisp")

To verbalize a schema, suppose you have made the schema the value of some
variable, say 'SCHEMA'. Decide on a name of the verbalized version,
say 'SCHEMA-IN-WORDS'. Then do

(v 'schema-in-words schema)

If the output is partially abbreviated by the standard-out printing, use

(show schema-in-words)
