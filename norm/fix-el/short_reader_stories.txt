Sometimes he sits there all day long.
The little girls like to dig in the sand, and pick up pretty shells.
They watch the waves as they roll up on the beach, and break into white foam.
They sometimes make little houses of sand, and build walls around them; and they dig wells with their small wooden spades.
They have been picking up shells for their little sister.
She is too young to come to the beach.
I think all children like to play by the seaside when the sun is bright, and the wind does not blow too hard.

Six birds are on this tree.
Birds sing in the trees.
Birds make their nests in the trees.
They lay pretty eggs in them.
The old birds feel sad to lose their eggs.

Manuela and Carmen live near the sea.
They find many pretty things on the seashore.

Mary and Lucy have come up from the pond nearby, with brave old Ponto, to see them play.
When they toss the ball up in the air, and try to catch it, Ponto runs to get it in his mouth.
Now the ball is lost.
They all look for it under the trees and in the grass; but they can not see it.
Where can it be?
See!
Ponto has found it.
Here he comes with it.
He will lay it at little Lucy's feet, or put it in her hand.

What a bright day this is!
The sky is as blue as it can be.
Lucy and her mother are in the woods.
They have found a good place under a green tree.
They sit in the shade of the tree and listen to the birds that are singing above them.
Robin Redbreast is in the tree.
Lucy sees him as he jumps about among the leaves.
By and by he will fly away to his nest.
Lucy wonders where it is.

Our mother says we may go and see little Lucy.
We are going some day in June, soon after our school is out.
We do not have school in June.
Lucy's home is far away.
We shall ride there in the big wagon with father and mother.
Father says it will take all day to go so far.
Mother says I must be sure to take Lucy some  of our good apples.
I will take her a book, too.
I am sure Lucy will be glad to see us.
She will run out to the wagon and tell us so.
What do you think she will say?

We have bees in our garden.
They live in a little house.
This little house is called a hive.

One day Ann and Frank went to the lake with Rover.
Rover can swim well, so Frank made him go into the water after a stick.
Pretty soon he came out with the stick in his mouth.
He did not like the fun so well as Frank, for the water was a little cold.
They had a fine time for a while with Rover, and then set out for home, as it was late in the day, and they could not stay long.
On the way home, Rover saw a rabbit, and away he went after it, as fast as he could go.
Ann and Frank ran too, but could not keep up with Rover and the rabbit.

Sheep are washed and sheared some time in the month of June.
This should be done quite early in the month, before the hot days begin.
It is fine sport for those who look on, hut not much fun for the sheep.
It is best for the sheep to have the wool taken off; otherwise they would suffer in the summer time.
When the time comes for washing the sheep, they are driven to a pond or a little river.
Then they are thrown into the water, one at a time.
The men who are in the water catch them, and squeeze the wet wool with their hands to get the dirt all out of it.
Then the wool is thoroughly dried, the sheep are taken to the shearer; and he cuts off the wool with a large pair of shears.
It is then dyed, spun, and woven into cloth.
In a short time, before the cold winter comes, new wool grows out on the sheep.
By the corning of spring there is so much, that it must be cut off again.

Yesterday Ramon found this nest.
Do you see it?
The mother bird sits on the nest.
She has five blue eggs.

It is a good home for them.
Soon there will be little birds in it.

These are the little birds.
How many are there?
Their mouths are open.
They are hungry.
The mother bird will feed them.
She has a grasshopper in her mouth.
Can the little birds fly?
No they are too young.
If they try to fly, they will fall.
Soon they will be stronger.
Then their mother will teach them to fly.She will teach them to sing, too.

It is evening, and the sun is about to set.
The day will soon be gone.
Let us sit here on the soft grass and look at the bright clouds in the west.
Do you think there is any rain in those little clouds?
Oh, no!
Those are not rain clouds.
See how pretty they are!
Some of the clouds are red, and some are as yellow as gold.
It is the light of the sun that makes them look so bright.
Soon they will all fade away in the blue sky.
Soon it will be night, and the moon and stars will shine for us.

See, Rosy, here is an apple tree.
It stands on a big hill.
See the apples on the tree.

I can not tell you, Rosy, but I think they are sweet.
Will you please get me an apple?

Here is a big apple for you.

A few years ago, some English officers went out to hunt.
When coming home from their day's sport, they found a little tiger kitten.
They took it with them and tied it, with a collar and chain, to the pole of their tent.
It played about, to the delight of all who saw it.
One evening, just as it was growing dark, they heard a sound that frightened them greatly.
It was the roar of a tiger.
The kitten pulled at the chain, and tried to break away.
With a sharp cry, it answered the voice outside.
All at once, a large tigress bounded into the middle of the tent.
She caught her kitten by the neck, and broke the chain which bound it.
Then turning to the door of the tent, she dashed away as suddenly as she had come.

When winter comes, the days are short and the nights are long.

It brings snow and ice.
It makes our hands and faces cold.
We do not like the north wind.
All children are happy when winter comes.
