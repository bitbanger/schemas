Tom wanted an apple from his apple tree.
There was a beautiful one right at the top of the tree.
He tried to climb the tree but couldn't reach the apple.
He found a long stick that he used to knock it down.
The apple fell and hit him on the head.

Joe was bit by a cat when he was very young.
Since then, he has always been scared of cats.
One day at school, a cat came up to him and played with him.
Joe had a lot of fun with the cat.
Now, Joe is not scared of cats.
