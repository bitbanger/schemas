; Match outline:
;	- first, modify schema syntax to have char formulas AND * formulas for ?eNs
;	- next, modify schema syntax to give certainty scores to certain formulas
;	- take a story ep, and unify its char formula w/ schema steps until match
;	- once it matches, fill in the schema and replace the matched step w/ the story ep, adding the extra modifiers, and adding all * formulas as atemporal constraints
