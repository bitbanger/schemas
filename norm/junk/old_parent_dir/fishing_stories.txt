These men fish in the sea. They have a large net. They carry the net in a boat and drip it into the water. Soon they pull it to the shore. Sometimes they find many fish in it. The women put the fish in the basket and take them home. Pedro and Simeon like to watch the men in the boats and help pull in the net. 

Simeon and Pedro like to fish. Sometimes they sit on the bridge. Sometimes they sit on the bank of the river. They have poles, long lines, and little iron hooks. This morning Simeon caught a large fish. Pedro caught many small ones. The boys caught some crabs, too. They use a net to catch the crabs. 

There are fish in their pond. They are very nice fish. We will come and catch them. We will take the long rod, and the hook and line. We must have a bag, too. It must be strong, to keep the fish safe.
